# Overview
Shipping vehicles is accomplished by [placing a new Order](https://runbuggy.docs.stoplight.io/reference/orders/orders/createorderusingpost).  Each individual vehicle being shipped is represented in the system as a [Vehicle Transfer Order](https://runbuggy.docs.stoplight.io/reference/orders/vehicle-transfer-orders/getvehicletransferorderusingget).
